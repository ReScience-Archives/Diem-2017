# Introduction

Witthoft and Karniadakis [1] introduced a bidirectional model for communication via chemical signalling within the neurovascular unit (NVU), which comprises a neuron, astrocyte and small artery. Functional hyperemia is an important mechanism in the brain, by which an increased neuronal metabolism leads to an increase of blood flow in surrounding arteries in order to maintain adequate oxygen and nutrient supply to the active neurons. This process works via a cascade of chemical signalling processes from neurons to astrocytes to arteries. The unidirectional vascular response to increased neuronal demands has previously been modelled [2,3], however, there is evidence that vascular activity also has an effect on neurons [4]. This bidirectional response is implemented in [1]. The paper contains the differential equations that are being modelled, however no code repository is provided. The model is useful for the investigation of the effect of cerebrovascular diseases on the brain and thus an openly available code repository reproducing the results of this paper will be helpful to other researchers.

# Methods

The paper indicates that the original code was written in Matlab, while the reproduction presented here is written in Python 3.5. The model is given as a series of ordinary differential equations (ODE), which are implemented as a function nvu(). This function is solved using the scipy.integrate library. Initial attempts to solve the system of ODE using the standard function odeint() failed. Instead, the equations can be solved using the function ode() with the integration method set to "lsoda", which automatically selects between the Adams method for non-stiff and BDF for stiff problems. The ODE system described in [1] is a stiff system.

The code was implemented following the descriptions of the equations in [1], but upon cross-checking equations against their equivalents in [2,3,4] it became evident that some of the equations contain typographical errors. This was confirmed after contacting the authors of [1]. Changes to the equations are as follows:

* $I_{\Sigma K}$ in (20) should be defined as $I_{\Sigma K} = -J_{\Sigma K} C_{astr} \gamma$
* (31) $I_K = g_K n (V_m - v_K)$
* (A.1) Term $\frac{1}{2 \alpha} I_{Ca}$ should be $\alpha I_{Ca}$
* (A.6) The brackets around the exponential function are set incorrectly, it should read $\exp \left( \frac{-(y' - y'_0)^2}{2 \left[ y'_1/(y' + y'_2) \right]^{2 y'_4}} \right) - y'_3$
* Decimal of parameter $a$ in Table B2 is in the wrong place, it should read $a = 502.65$ $\mu m^2$


# Results

![Figure caption](figures/fig1.png){#fig:fig1}

Results should be compared with original results and you have to explain why
you think they are the same or why they may differ (qualitative result vs
quantitative result). Note that it is not necessary to redo all the original
analysis of the results.


# Conclusion

Conclusion, at the very minimum, should indicate very clearly if you were able
to replicate original results. If it was not possible but you found the reason
why (error in the original results), you should exlain it.
