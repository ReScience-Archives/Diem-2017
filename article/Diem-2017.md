# Introduction

Witthoft and Karniadakis [1] introduced a bidirectional model for communication via chemical signalling within the neurovascular unit (NVU), which comprises a neuron, astrocyte and small artery. Functional hyperemia is an important mechanism in the brain, by which an increased neuronal metabolism leads to an increase of blood flow in surrounding arteries in order to maintain adequate oxygen and nutrient supply to the active neurons. This process works via a cascade of chemical signalling processes from neurons to astrocytes to arteries. The unidirectional vascular response to increased neuronal demands has previously been modelled [2,3], however, there is evidence that vascular activity also has an effect on neurons [4]. This bidirectional response is implemented in [1]. The paper contains the differential equations that are being modelled, however no code repository is provided. The model is useful for the investigation of the effect of cerebrovascular diseases on the brain and thus an openly available code repository reproducing the results of this paper will be helpful to other researchers.

# Methods

The paper indicates that the original code was written in Matlab, while the reproduction presented here is written in Python 3.5. The model is given as a series of ordinary differential equations (ODE), which are implemented as a function nvu(). This function is solved using the scipy.integrate library. Initial attempts to solve the system of ODE using the standard function odeint() failed. Instead, the equations can be solved using the function ode() with the integration method set to "lsoda", which automatically selects between the Adams method for non-stiff and BDF for stiff problems. The ODE system described in [1] is a stiff system. Values for absolute and relative tolerance have to be set in order for the simulation to finish successfully. These are given in the results section as they differ for different simulations. 

The code was implemented following the descriptions of the equations in [1], but upon cross-checking equations against their equivalents in [2,3,4] it became evident that some of the equations contain typographical errors. This was confirmed after contacting the authors of [1]. Changes to the equations are as follows:

* $I_{\Sigma K}$ in (20) should be defined as $I_{\Sigma K} = -J_{\Sigma K} C_{astr} \gamma$
* (31) $I_K = g_K n (V_m - v_K)$
* (A.1) Term $\frac{1}{2 \alpha} I_{Ca}$ should be $\alpha I_{Ca}$
* (A.6) The brackets around the exponential function are set incorrectly, it should read $\exp \left( \frac{-(y' - y'_0)^2}{2 \left[ y'_1/(y' + y'_2) \right]^{2 y'_4}} \right) - y'_3$
* Decimal of parameter $a$ in Table B2 is in the wrong place, it should read $a = 502.65$ $\mu m^2$
* The value for [Ca\textsuperscript{2+}]\textsubscript{ER} is not given, but can be found in [2] as [Ca\textsuperscript{2+}]\textsubscript{ER} $= 400 \mu m$

Furthermore, upon correspondence with the original authors, an equilibration phase ($t = -20 -- 0 s$) without stimulus presentation had to be implemented. This step is not mentioned in the original publication, but is vital to obtain the correct results. 


# Results

Results from the code presented in this repository aim at reproducing Figure 5 in the original application, which shows ion and voltage dynamics over a simulation period of 50 s.

![Astrocyte and arterial response during neuronal stimulation. This figure is a reproduction of Figure 5 in the original publication using the code in this repository. Potassium (K\textsuperscript{+})) in both the synaptic and perivascular space match their corresponding plots in the original publication, as do calcium (Ca\textsuperscript{2+}) in the smooth muscle cell and the arterial radius. Differences can be seen for Ca\textsuperscript{2+} in the astrocyte, EET and the astrocyte membrane potential V\textsubscript{k}. In the case of astrocytic Ca\textsuperscript{2+} and EET the first peak overshoots compared to the results in the original publication, while the remainder of the plots match the original publication. Most interesting is the shape of V\textsubscript{k}, which in the first half looks very different from the reproduced figure. Additionally, V\textsubscript{k} overshoots into positive values, which is not given in the original publication. Simulation tolerance values atol=1e-, rtol=1e-7.](figures/fig1.png){#fig:fig1}

Figure @fig:fig1 shows the results obtained from the code in this repository. Potassium (K\textsuperscript{+})) in both the synaptic and perivascular space match their corresponding plots in the original publication, as do calcium (Ca\textsuperscript{2+}) in the smooth muscle cell and the arterial radius. Differences can be seen for Ca\textsuperscript{2+} in the astrocyte, EET and the astrocyte membrane potential V\textsubscript{k}. In the case of astrocytic Ca\textsuperscript{2+} and EET the first peak overshoots compared to the results in the original publication, while the remainder of the plots match the original publication.

Additionally, V\textsubscript{k} overshoots into positive values, which is not given in the original publication.


# Conclusion

Conclusion, at the very minimum, should indicate very clearly if you were able
to replicate original results. If it was not possible but you found the reason
why (error in the original results), you should exlain it.
